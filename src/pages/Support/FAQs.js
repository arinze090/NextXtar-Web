      <p>Release Processing</p>
      <p>
        What happens after I upload my release? <br />
        Once you've successfully uploaded your music, NextXtar reviews the music
        itself, the metadata, and the artwork. If we have any questions, we'll
        get in touch with you. This whole process ensures that everything aligns
        with the guidelines set by the digital music stores and blogs.

      <p>

        Sure thing! You can make changes to your upload before it's approved on
        the NextXtar App. Once it's been distributed to the digital music
        platforms, though, it takes about a month before any changes can be
        implemented.

      </p>

      <p>Sampling on Beats</p>
      <p>
        I use samples in my beats. <br />
        Is that allowed? Using samples is fine, as long as you have permission
        from the copyright holder of the music and the owner of the recording,
        which is often the record label. Make sure you've got the proper
        permissions for any samples you use.

        with your new artist name. If you've already uploaded music under your
        current name, we can help you change it. Just fill out a form, and if
        needed, update your artwork.
